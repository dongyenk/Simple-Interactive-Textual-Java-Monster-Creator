# OOP-and-User-Input-Output-and-Reading-from-and-Writing-to-files
A simple interactive Java Program of mine.

It uses object oriented programming, inheritence, reading from and writing to external files, and handling user input.

It has a menu telling the user how to interact with the software.

## IMPORTANT FILES

Entity.java <- super class of Monster and Treasure

Monster.java <- contains code that reads from and writes to file
